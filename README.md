# ChatRoom
This a project about real time message exchanges between a chat server and a chat client.
People will join the chat server via their chat clients and after a connection is completed
they will be able to communicate with each other by using a UFI ( User Friendly Interface ).
The server will be able to connect to a database to store the chatroom activity in a Logs table.
